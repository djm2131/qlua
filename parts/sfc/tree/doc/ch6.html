<a id="6."></a><h1>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compilation</h1>

<p>#F compiler translates #F source code into C code. #F supports separate
compilation and provides a way to specify dependencies between source
components (<em>compilation units</em>). The compiler implements full tail recursion,
using trampoline compilation techniques similar to the ones used by Gambit C and
MIT Scheme [<a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/feeley97compiling.html">Feeley97</a>].

The parts of the C code inserted by the compiler conform to ANSI C standard [C89].</p>

<a id="6.1."></a><h2>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compilation units</h2>

<p>#F compiler translates #F <em>compilation unit</em> into C. 
A #F compilation unit is a single file, conventionally ending in <tt>.sf</tt>,
that contains #F source code. The result of the translation is a
single C file with the same base name as the #F file and the  
extension <tt>.c</tt>, located in the same directory as the original.</p>

<a id="6.1.1."></a><h3>6.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global namespace</h3>

<p>#F has a simplistic model of the global namespace (top level environment), 
borrowed from C and traditional Scheme. All top-level bindings occupy a single 
namespace shared by all units. There is no import or export of bindings; all 
top level bindings in all units of a program are accessible from any unit (the 
compiler may need to know where to look for, but there is no name resolution).
In large-scale projects, name conflicts can be prevented in the traditional
Scheme way by wrapping internal definitions in <tt>let</tt> forms or
following a consistent naming convention. #F macro system supports
simple name aliasing, which works equally well for variables and
keywords, e.g.:</p>

<pre>(define-syntax zap! acme.util.zap!)
(define-syntax withcz acme.sugar.with-current-zapping)
</pre>

<p>Note that the original long names will still be visible.</p>

<a id="6.1.2."></a><h3>6.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit dependencies</h3>

<p>A compilation unit may depend on other compilation units in two ways.
First, it may use macros defined in other units. Second, it can contain
initialization code which depends on effects of initialization code in other
units (top-level procedures get their values during the initialization 
of the unit that contains their definitions).</p>

<p>#F treats both kind of dependencies in the same way. If unit A depends
on units B and C, it should contain explicit <em>processing instructions</em>,
telling the compiler to <em>visit</em> B and C before compiling A, and
arrange the initialization order so that A is initialized after B and C.</p>

<a id="fload"></a>
<table class="proto" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><code>#fload "<abbr>filename</abbr>"</code></td><td align="right">processing instruction</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <tt>#fload</tt> instruction tells the compiler that the unit being
compiled depends on the unit named <abbr>filename</abbr>. At the macroexpansion
phase, <abbr>filename</abbr> will be processed by the macroexpander as if
its contents were present at the point of the instruction {<em>what happens to nested instructions? &ndash;esl</em>}.  
All processing instructions for unit dependencies should precede any
regular #F forms in the unit.</p>

<a id="6.1.3."></a><h3>6.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkage</h3>

<p>When a compilation unit is translated into C, each variable bound by a top level 
<tt>define</tt>, assigned to via <tt>set!</tt>, or simply referred to in the code
produces a single global C variable. If a variable is neither defined nor assigned to
in the unit, the corresponding global C variable is attributed with <tt>extern</tt>
specifier. Otherwise, the C variable has no <tt>extern</tt> specifier, which makes it
defined in the unit for the system linker. In both cases, the global C variables
have external linkage.</p>

<p>This simple strategy allows #F compiler to determine the unit where a variable 
is defined automatically and pass the correct linkage information to the system linker.
When the program is assembled from the compiled units, the linker will report all
cases of undefined and redefined top level variables.</p>

<p>As a result, every global identifier has a single place of definition and
can not be assigned to from the units other than the unit where it is defined.
Limiting all assignments to a single unit has many benefits. In particular, it
allows the compiler to perform single assignment analysis, opening possibilities
for inline substitution and call sequence optimizations.</p>


<a id="6.1.4."></a><h3>6.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main entry point</h3>

<p>When the compiled units are linked together to form an executable
program, there has to be a way to specify an entry point for the program.
#F compiler adopted the C model of identifying the entry point by name.</p>

<a id="main"></a>
<table class="proto" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><code>(main <abbr>argv</abbr>)</code></td><td align="right">entry point procedure</td></tr>
</table>

<p><em>Semantics:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If a unit defines a global procedure called
<tt>main</tt>, this unit is identified as the <em>main unit</em> of the program
and at the start of the program and initialization of all units specified
as dependencies of the main unit (recursively), the control will be transferred 
to the <tt>main</tt> procedure with the original argument vector passed to it
as the single parameter. When this procedure returns the false value (<tt>#f</tt>), 
the program will terminate with exit code <tt>0</tt> (a success). Any true value
returned from <tt>main</tt> will be mapped to non-zero exit code in an
unspecified manner.</p>

<p>When emitting C code for the main unit, the compiler adds all the pieces
needed to start and run the application. This includes C <tt>main</tt> function
and a minimal runtime system, described in [Ch7].</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The fact that a certain unit is <em>linked</em>
into the final program does not mean that it will be initialized and that the
global variables it defines will have the expected values. If a unit is not
reachable through any dependency chain starting at the main unit, it will
not be initialized and all global variables it defines will have their
default values (false). In practice, failure to <tt>#fload</tt> a module
often causes the program to crash when a procedure from that module is
invoked.</p>

<a id="6.2."></a><h2>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including C code</h2>

<p>Since the compiler emits C code, it can allow the programmer to inject
pieces of C code into the output an no extra cost. This functionality is
made available through three special forms which can only be used at
the top level of a unit. All three forms do not allow expressions as
arguments and have no value. In other respects they behave as regular
forms and can be produced as the result of macroexpansion.</p>

<a id="include"></a>
<table class="proto" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><code>(%include "<abbr>filename</abbr>")</code></td><td align="right">syntax</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>(%include &lt;<abbr>filename</abbr>&gt;)</code></td><td align="right">syntax</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These forms tell the compiler to add the corresponding <tt>#incude</tt>
definitions to the prologue of the generated C file and C files produced
by compilation of the units dependent of the unit being compiled. The compiler 
adds includes for <tt>stdio.h</tt>, <tt>stddef.h</tt>, <tt>stdlib.h</tt>, 
and <tt>assert.h</tt> by default, so those need not to be included 
explicitly.</p>

<a id="definition"></a>
<table class="proto" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><code>(%definition "<abbr>code</abbr>")</code></td><td align="right">syntax</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>(%localdef "<abbr>code</abbr>")</code></td><td align="right">syntax</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These forms insert arbitrary C code immediately after the includes and
standard definitions added by the compiler. The first form (<tt>%definition</tt>)
injects the code into the unit being compiled and all the dependent units, so it 
is normally used for C macros, function prototypes and inline functions. The
second form (<tt>%localdef</tt>) does not insert any code into dependent
units, so it is usually used to define C functions. Example:</p>

<pre>(%include &lt;math.h&gt)
(%definition "extern double square(double);")
(%localdef "double square(double x) {
  return x*x;
}")
</pre>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The fact that the syntax of these forms uses
string literals does not mean that a complete #F program that uses these
forms should provide a run-time implementation of strings (or lists for
that matter). Only parts of the surface syntax of #F program that are
manipulated at run time need a runtime implementation.</p>

<a id="6.3."></a><h2>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compilation technique</h2>

<p>The compiler follows a simple strategy for implementing full tail recursion
and unrestricted continuations while compiling into portable C. All #F
code in a compilation unit is compiled into a single <em>host</em> procedure,
where all internal transfers of control are implemented with C <tt>switch</tt>,
<tt>case</tt>s, labels, and <tt>goto</tt>s. </p>

<p>In a general case, #F control frames are allocated in the garbage-collected 
heap, and the resulting C program does not use C stack until the control has 
to cross the boundary of a compilation unit. At this point, the host function 
returns to its caller which serves as a dispatcher (a <em>trampoline</em>)
responsible for inter-host transfers of control. The dispatcher&rsquo;s job is 
to locate the host function holding the target control point and to call into 
this procedure with the control point as argument. It is the responsibility 
of the host function to transfer the control within itself so that the execution
continues from the correct statement.</p>

<a id="6.3.1."></a><h2>6.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host functions</h2>

<p>Host functions receive a run-time representation of control point
within the host and return a run-time representation of a control point
not found in the host. A control point (or <em>case</em>) is represented
as an address of an element in the array of function pointers. In C code 
generated for a #F compilation unit, a static array of function pointers
is generated with one element per each control point reachable from other
units. All pointers in this array point to the unit&rsquo;s host function,
so the host function for a given case can be found by dereferencing the
address.</p>

<p>Each host function starts with a prologue, where global variables
needed to keep track of the execution are copied to local variables for
faster access. The prologue is followed by a <tt>switch</tt>, dispatching
on an offset of the current <em>case</em> from the beginning of the unit&rsquo;s
array of cases, and the control ends up on an actual C <tt>case</tt> label,
where the C code for the control point is located. Any transfer of control
to an unknown location starts from jumping to the beginning of the switch
statement in the local host function. If the offset is negative or larger 
than the last C <tt>case</tt> label in the current host, the <tt>default:</tt>
statement of the switch flushes local copies of the global execution
environment back to global variables and returns the failed case to the
host function&rsquo;s caller, where the control is transferred to another
host and the process is repeated.</p>

<a id="6.3.2."></a><h2>6.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimizations</h2>

<p>#F compiler attempts to improve on the general mechanism described
above by trying to generate <em>helper functions</em> and making 
<em>direct jumps</em> to statically known destinations.</p>

<p><em>Helper functions</em> are C functions produced from #F procedures 
that satisfy the restrictions imposed by C memory management and calling
conventions. Currently, the restrictions do not allow any allocation
from garbage-collected heap, multiple return values, getting access
to the current continuation or returning to a continuation other than
the current, or calling functions other than itself or a previously
defined helper function. A helper function can call itself any way
it likes and contain internal loops with tail calls.</p>

<p>If a top-level #F procedure qualifies to be compiled as a helper
function, the corresponding C code is inserted before the host function
and the calls to the procedure are replaced with C expressions for
the calls to the helper function. The fact that C runtime stack is
used by helper functions does not break the tail-recursive behavior
of #F programs because there is a fixed limit on the number of C
stack frames used by tail calls, equal to the number of helper
functions in the current unit (assuming the worst situation where
they call each other tail-recursively in the reverse order of their
definition).</p>

<p><em>Direct jumps</em> are generated for all intra-host transfers
of controls where the target of the transfer is statically known to
the compiler. Such targets receive their unique C labels and the
transfer of control is implemented via C <tt>goto</tt> statements.</p>
