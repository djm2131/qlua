<p>#F (False Scheme) is a minimalist Scheme implementation tailored to
the needs of practical programmers comfortable with both Scheme and C and
willing to spend some additional effort in order to build a system that
fits their needs better than any existing Scheme with an FFI interface. 
The implementation is based on a (reduced)Scheme-to-C compiler with no 
knowledge of any data types and a stripped down set of syntactic forms,
that includes a few basic expression types, a flexible mechanism for
extending the language by combining fragments of C code, and an extended
version of R<sup>5</sup>RS macro system which doubles as a compiler
backend.</p>

<a id="i.1."></a><h2>Backround</h2>
<p>Henry Baker in his <em>Critique of DIN Kernel Lisp Definition Version 1.2</em> 
[<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/t20403j8v7471892/">1</a>] 
laid down the desiderata for a Kernel language:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1pc; margin-right: 1pc;">
Presumably, a <em>kernel</em> language is a <em>minimal</em> language on top 
of which a larger language can be built. <em>Since its primary function 
is being an implementation language for function libraries and a target language 
for macros,</em> a Kernel language need not be particularly &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo; 
or provide a lot of flexibility in its interface. Although it is desirable, 
a Kernel language does not have to be a strict subset of the full language, 
since some of its features may not be visible in the full language. 
A Kernel language should be simpler and more efficient to implement than 
the full language, however, to avoid an <em>abstraction inversion,</em> 
in which a simpler notion is defined in terms of more complex notions.</p>

<p>Later, he adds:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1pc; margin-right: 1pc;">
Preserving a <em>small definition</em> for DKLisp requires that the standard 
ruthlessly eliminate non-primitive notions to focus on simple, efficient, 
modular primitives from which the rest of a Lisp system can be easily and 
efficiently constructed. In other words, DKLisp primitives must be chosen 
not for their ability keep a user program small, but for their ability to 
keep an implementation small and fast.</p>

<p>Baker's 15-year-old program echoes the central design principle of Scheme 
(&ldquo;removing the weaknesses and restrictions&hellip;&rdquo;) but goes 
farther, arguing for a smaller language with greater emphasis on implementation 
efficiency and language cleanliness. This approach harmonizes with the modern 
trend toward smaller domain-specific languages (DSLs) which do one specific thing
but do it well. Building a DSL atop of a kernel language allows the designer 
to concentrate on what is needed for the task at hand, eliminating 
excess baggage.</p>

<a id="i.2."></a><h2>Libraries and FFIs</h2>

<p>In recent years it became more and more obvious that in order to be
able to construct a large system around a simple kernel, the kernel has
to provide an access to low-level system interfaces and libraries. It is
no longer reasonable to expect that every new language will get its own
implementation of regular expressions, an XML parser, a PDF writer, even
though all of them can be implemented from scratch on top of a minimal
number/string/list set of primitives. The situation is even worse when
it comes to system interfaces (interprocess comunications, networking
etc.) &mdash; they can only be built on top of a <em>foreign 
function interface</em> (FFI).</p> 

<p>FFIs, as they are implemented in traditional Lisp/Scheme systems,
rely on a complex set of data conversion rules, dynamic code generation
and other platform-specific methods of getting access to the underlying <em>application
binary interface</em> (ABI). Although a lot of effort has been spent on
hiding the internal complexity of the interface from the user and handling
platform-dependent calling conventions, FFIs remain fragile because many
programmatic interfaces are are portable only on a source code level
(and thus should be qualified as APIs, not ABIs).</p>

<p>What an ideal FFI can look like is demonstrated by C++. All that
is needed to call C functions from C++ is to wrap their prototypes in 
<tt>extern</tt> <tt>"C"</tt> <tt>{}</tt> to prevent name mangling. The 
resulting C++ program is (almost) as portable as if it were written in 
C directly.</p>

<p>#F, being built around a Scheme-to-C compiler, is able to provide an 
FFI of comparable simplicity by allowing the programmer to write C code 
fragments to be included verbatim into the output code. As an extreme example
of this practice, here is a complete #F source code for the ubiquitous
&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program:</p>

<pre>
(%include &lt;stdio.h&gt;)

(define main 
  (lambda (argv)
    (%prim! "void(printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\"))")))
</pre>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This &ldquo;Scheme&rdquo; program does
not use any Scheme data types, so none have to be defined. The resulting
C file is <tt>7</tt>KB long and it includes a complete run-time system
needed to execute the code.</p>

<a id="i.3."></a><h2>Portability</h2>

<p><i>You are in a maze of twisty little <tt>#ifdef</tt>s, all different.</i><br />

<!-- wikipedia quote (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C) 
ANSI C is now supported by almost all the widely used compilers. 
Most of the C code being written nowadays is based on ANSI C. 
Any program written only in standard C and without any hardware 
dependent assumptions is virtually guaranteed to compile correctly 
on any platform with a conforming C implementation. Without such 
precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform 
or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of 
non-standard libraries, such as GUI libraries, or to the reliance 
on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact 
size of certain data types and byte endianness.
