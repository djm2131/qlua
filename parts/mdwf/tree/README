This is a SciDAC L3 Moebius domain wall fermion implementation. It targets
the following backends:

c99-32    -- any conforming C99 compiler on a 32-bit platform
c99-64    -- any conforming C99 compiler on a 64-bit platform
cee-32    -- any conforming K&R compiler on a 32-bit platform
cee-64    -- any conforming K&R compiler on a 64-bit platform
bgl-xlc   -- IBM XLC 8.0 or higher on BG/L or BG/P

For details on building the package see INSTALL in this directory.

For hints about integration into higher level LQCD codes, see the tests/ tree.

If you are interested in porting to other backends, read the sources and talk
to me once you understand the structure of the code.
