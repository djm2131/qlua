Authors of QDP
==============

The QDP API was designed as a part of the National Computational
Infrastructure for Lattice Gauge Theory (http://www.lqcd.org/).
Many members of the Software Committee contributed to the design.

The libraries, example programs and some of the documentation were written
by James Osborn (josborn at physics.bu.edu).  Much of the documentation was
written by Carleton Detar (detar at physics.utah.edu).
