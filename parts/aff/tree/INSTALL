To install the library, you need to create a configuration for your machine.
Consult existing configurations in config.* for inspiration. If none of the
preexisting configuration fits your machine, choose one that is close enough
and tweak it. Please send us back a new configuration file once it is working
and we will include it in the official distribution.

The following is the acutual build procedure we use on the MIT Blue Gene.

1. Unpack the distribution:

% bunzip2 < lhpc-afff-1.0.0.tar.bz | tar -xf -

2. Build the library.

% make CONFIG=config.bgl

3. Install it

% su
# make CONFIG=config.bgl install prefix=/opt/SciDEC/fen64/lhpc-aff-1.0.0
# exit

4. After building the library you may build and install an optional Python
package. It requires python 2.5 or newer. Follow the steps below

4.1 Go to the python directory in the AFF distribution

% cd python

4.2 Build the interface package

% python2.5 setup.py build

4.3 Either copy the aff module to your personal python den, or install it on
the machine globally (you might need root priveleges for this step.)

% su
# python2.5 setup.py install
