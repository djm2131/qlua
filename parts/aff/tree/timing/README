This directory contains scripts for timing AFF.
To use these files do the following:

1. Build lhpc-aff for the platform and install it. Here is an
   example:

    % AFFTEST=$HOME/aff-test
    % make CONFIG=linux prefix=$AFFTEST -C .. install

2. Copy run-me and mk-model to the directory you are going
   run tests in. The full test will take about 40GB of disk
   space is needed. If not enough space is afailable the test
   will stop after consuming available space on the file system.

    % TESTDIR=/scratch/$USER
    % cp run-me mk-model $TESTDIR

3. In the test directory, run the test

    % cd $TESTDIR
    % ./run-me $AFFTEST > aff.log
    
4. Relax. The test may take some time.
