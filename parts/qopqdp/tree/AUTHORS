Authors of QOPQDP
=================

The QOP API was designed as a part of the National Computational
Infrastructure for Lattice Gauge Theory (http://www.lqcd.org/).
Many members of the Software Committee contributed to the design.

Most of the libraries and example programs were written by
James Osborn (josborn at physics.bu.edu).

Ludmila Levkova contributed the Symanzik 1-loop gauge force
and FNMAT version of the asqtad force.

Carleton Detar also contributed to the FNMAT version of the
asqtad force.
