This is a SciDAC L3 twisted wilson fermion implementation. It targets
the following backends:

cee       -- any conforming K&R compiler on a 32-bit platform
cee-64    -- any conforming K&R compiler on a 64-bit platform
bgq-xlc   -- IBM XLC on BG/Q

For details on building the package see INSTALL in this directory.

If you are interested in porting to other backends, read the sources and talk
to me once you understand the structure of the code.
