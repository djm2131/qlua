Authors of QLA
==============

The QLA API was designed as a part of the National Computational
Infrastructure for Lattice Gauge Theory (http://www.lqcd.org/).  Many
members of the Software Committee contributed to the design.

The main part of the library, test suite and documentation was written
by Carleton Detar (detar at physics.utah.edu).

The conversion to use autoconf and automake along with many other
modifications and the inclusion of the optimized routines was done by
James Osborn (josborn at physics.bu.edu).

Joy Khoriaty (khoriaty at lns.mit.edu) added the
"--enable-backend-test-cmd" configure option.
